# Introduction
This repository contains pre-made resources for the Databases Delta course.

You can find NoSQL course resources in the `NoSQL` folder and SQL course resources in the `PLSQL` folder.

You will need to install the following software to use these resources:
- VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for running the OracleSQL VM as it is too complicated to get a fully working OracleSQL installation on any non-Windows operating system, unfortunately. Docker deployment seems to have issues as well.
- Docker (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for running the Redis, Cassandra, MongoDB and Neo4j databases. In case you are on windows and therefore VirtualBox and Docker do not work together very well due to WSL2 being enabled, you can run docker in the prepared Debian based virtual machine inside virtualbox.

Each of the folders contains a `readme` file with instructions on how to use the resources.




Also, there's a totally unrelated video:
